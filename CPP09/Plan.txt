The idea of this project is to create an algo using STL containers to solve
each exercise.



------Overview------

Containers avaliable.

-----
1 - Sequence Containers.
"Meaning they can be accessed sequentially"
Array.
Vector.
Deque.
List.
Forward_list


----
2 - Associative Containers.
"Store data in some sorted order. faster search and faster insert and delete" 
O(log n) "Works on Red Black Trees"
Set
Map
Multiset
MultiMap

----
3 - Unordered Associative Containers

Unordered Set
Unordered Map
Unordered MultiSet
Unordered MultiMap


-----
4- Containers Adapters
"Contaienrs that provied a different interface for other containers.
They adapt the behavior of underlying containers to fit specific use cases.

Stack.
Queue.
Priority Queue.

------------------------------------

Mostly the Plan will be:

Since the first exercise is talking about data and value,
it's mostly a key value pair, which is acheieved by Map.


Second exercise will mostly be stack, why? In comptuer Architacture, "I  don't know if I  spelled wrong"
There is 4 types of addressing mode, one of whici is zero addressing and it's built on top of a stack.
So I'll do the stack with it.


Last one is about sorting, so i'll delay it until I understand the ford-johnson algorithem.
